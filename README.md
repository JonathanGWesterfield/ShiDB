# homemade_database
My attempt to create a *very* simple database from scratch to figure out how they work.

~~Trying to follow [this guide](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) but implement it in Java so I don't have to worry about super granular stuff in C.~~

Am following Edward Sciore Database Design and Implementation. The unedited SimpleDB code is in this repo as well under the `SimpleDB_3.3` as my example when I get stuck or the textbook has an errata. 

Maybe when I'm done, I'll try to make it more advanced using the [Database Systems Textbook.](https://people.inf.elte.hu/miiqaai/elektroModulatorDva.pdf)

More resources can be found in this [StackOverflow post](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/121653/create-my-own-database-system)

The ultimate goal is to understand this well enough to try tackling an in-memory or graph database (a very simple implementation of one).

Maybe a fun follow up project will be a graph database like [FlockDB](https://github.com/twitter-archive/flockdb/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/twitter/flockdb)


### Update 2/8/2026

It's been years since I've looked at this project so I'm going to start over. ShiDB-2.0 is where the newest attempt will be. I'm going to leave the original first try alone. Java has also advanced in recent years so I'll be using that latest (v25 I think)
