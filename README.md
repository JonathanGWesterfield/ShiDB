# homemade_database
My attempt to create a *very* simple database from scratch to figure out how they work.

Trying to follow [this guide](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) but implement it in Java so I don't have to worry about super granular stuff in C.

Maybe when I'm done, I'll try to make it more advanced using the [Database Systems Textbook.](https://people.inf.elte.hu/miiqaai/elektroModulatorDva.pdf)

The ultimate goal is to understand this well enough to try tackling an in-memory database (a very simple implementation of one).
